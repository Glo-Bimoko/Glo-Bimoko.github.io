At the time, I was juggling academic responsibilities and a budding curiosity about technology. My personal laptop was an old machine that struggled to keep up with the demands of modern software. Despite its limitations, it was my window to a world of endless possibilities.</p> <p>When I started university, I got my first personal laptop\u2014one that I wasn\u2019t obliged to share with anyone. That\u2019s where it truly began, even though I had tried learning to program since my high school days. With this laptop, I realized I could do anything I wanted. I came across the concept of Linux and spent days in the CPUT library learning and tinkering. Fortunately, the internet speed there was unparalleled, allowing me to download gigabytes of data in minutes.</p> <p>I soon realized that my laptop\u2019s potential was limited by its Windows operating system. This led me to dabble in Linux. Removing and reinstalling operating systems became second nature. As my studies required Windows, I learned to dual boot. After a few months, I became comfortable in Linux. To maximize my laptop\u2019s performance, I fully migrated to Linux, though I frequently hopped between distributions\u2014Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Pop!_OS, Kali Linux, Fedora, and Manjaro, to name a few. Eventually, I mastered the art of carrying an entire operating system on a USB stick, allowing me to work seamlessly from any computer.</p> <p>Many nights were spent in the library tinkering with Linux when I needed a break from studying for immunology or cell biology. This dual focus on biology and technology sparked ideas that bridged the two fields. Sometimes, instead of studying for upcoming biology tests, I found myself solving Python problems late into the night. Though I initially struggled with concepts like object-oriented programming, I couldn\u2019t resist the pull of combining biology with computation.</p> <p>When I discovered that my course included a specialization in molecular pathology, I was thrilled. It was a perfect blend of my love for molecular biology, which began in high school, and my growing interest in computation. During this time, I stumbled upon CS50x on YouTube.</p>"},{"location":"blog/posts/cs50final/#from-cs50x-to-cs50p","title":"From CS50x to CS50P","text":"<p>The excitement I felt while tinkering with simple algorithms during CS50x encouraged me to explore further. By the time I completed the course, I was hooked. I wanted to go deeper\u2014to understand not just how to program, but how to use it meaningfully. That\u2019s when I discovered CS50P, a Python-specific extension of the original course. Python, with its versatility and relevance to bioinformatics, was the perfect next step.</p> <p>CS50x challenged me to think at a low level, showing how computers operate at the memory level. While I found C daunting, the Python section was a breeze\u2014at least the functional programming part! After graduating, I enrolled in CS50P, my favorite language-focused course. Python felt intuitive, almost like English for computers. Enrolling in CS50P marked the start of a transformative journey.</p> <p>Balancing work and study was challenging, but David Malan\u2019s lectures kept me motivated. Sometimes I would complete an entire problem set in a few days; other times, it took weeks. Despite the challenges, I persevered, driven by the desire to integrate programming into my career.</p>"},{"location":"blog/posts/cs50final/#lessons-from-cs50p","title":"Lessons from CS50P","text":"<p>David Malan\u2019s mantra of breaking big problems into smaller, solvable parts became my guiding principle. Through problem sets and projects, I learned to approach challenges methodically. Concepts like loops, functions, and data structures transitioned from abstract ideas to powerful tools. Debugging, once a source of frustration, became an opportunity for growth.</p> <p>As I reached the end of the course, I secured a position at CPGR, working with microarray data. For my final project, I combined my biology and computational knowledge to create the Genomic Data Processor. Using Python\u2019s pandas library and the Biopython Entrez module, I built a tool to process genomic data\u2014a realization of my dream to leverage programming in bioinformatics. While Python isn\u2019t yet as adept as R for bioinformatics, I\u2019m excited for Biopython\u2019s future and plan to supplement my skills with R for statistical analysis.</p>"},{"location":"blog/posts/cs50final/#gratitude-for-the-journey","title":"Gratitude for the Journey","text":"<p>Looking back, my journey into programming wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the wealth of free resources available online.

The project utilized next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies to generate large datasets, which were subsequently analyzed to classify microorganisms present in complex samples.</p>"},{"location":"projects/16S_rRNA_genotyping/#key-objectives","title":"Key Objectives:","text":"<p>Amplification of 16S rRNA hypervariable regions Library preparation and sequencing on an Illumina platform Taxonomic classification using established bioinformatics pipelines Comparison of microbial diversity across different sample types</p> <p>Methodology 1. Sample Preparation and DNA Extraction</p> <p>The project began with the isolation of total genomic DNA from various sample types, including human gut microbiome and environmental samples. High-quality DNA was extracted using commercial kits, ensuring sufficient yield and purity for downstream processes. 2. PCR Amplification of 16S rRNA Gene</p> <p>The 16S rRNA gene's hypervariable regions, specifically V3-V4, were amplified using universal primers that are highly conserved across bacterial species. This PCR step was critical in generating a library of 16S amplicons for sequencing. 3. Illumina Sequencing</p> <p>After amplification, the library was prepared for sequencing on an Illumina platform. The use of paired-end sequencing allowed for greater coverage of the 16S rRNA gene, enhancing taxonomic resolution and providing more accurate community profiling. 4. Bioinformatics Pipeline</p> <p>Following sequencing, the raw reads were processed using the following bioinformatics tools:</p> <p>DADA2: This pipeline was employed for quality control, filtering, and dereplication of raw sequencing data, resulting in amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) rather than traditional operational taxonomic units (OTUs). DADA2 also corrected sequencing errors, leading to more accurate identification of species. QIIME2: This open-source platform was used to perform taxonomic classification based on reference databases like SILVA and Greengenes. QIIME2 also enabled downstream diversity analyses, including alpha and beta diversity metrics. Phyloseq: For data visualization, Phyloseq was used in R to generate plots of microbial composition and diversity, providing insights into the microbial ecosystems present in the samples.</p> <ol> <li>Taxonomic Classification</li> </ol> <p>The processed sequences were classified into taxonomic groups using reference databases. This step allowed for the identification of bacteria at the genus and species levels, providing a comprehensive overview of the microbial community structure. 6. Diversity Analysis</p> <p>Alpha diversity metrics (e.g., Shannon and Simpson indices) were calculated to assess the richness and evenness of bacterial species within each sample. Beta diversity analysis was performed to compare microbial compositions between different samples, using techniques such as principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and hierarchical clustering. Key Findings</p> <p>High Microbial Diversity: The human gut microbiome samples revealed a rich diversity of bacterial taxa, with a dominance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, consistent with previous studies. Environmental samples, on the other hand, exhibited greater variability, highlighting the influence of environmental factors on microbial composition.</p> <p>Taxonomic Resolution: The use of ASVs instead of OTUs provided higher taxonomic resolution, enabling more accurate identification of species. This approach also minimized the inflation of microbial diversity due to sequencing errors.</p> <p>Data-Driven Insights: The comparative analysis between human and environmental samples offered valuable insights into how microbial communities adapt and thrive in different conditions, suggesting potential applications in health, agriculture, and environmental monitoring.</p>"},{"location":"projects/16S_rRNA_genotyping/#future-work-and-applications","title":"Future Work and Applications","text":"<p>Building on this project, the workflow can be expanded to explore:</p> <p>Metagenomic sequencing: For deeper functional analysis of the microbiome, integrating metagenomics would allow the identification of genes involved in critical metabolic pathways.
