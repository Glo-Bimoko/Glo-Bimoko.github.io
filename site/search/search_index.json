Despite significant advancements in antibiotics and public health initiatives, drug-resistant TB continues to pose a major challenge. Enter bacteriophages, or phages\u2014viruses that infect bacteria. In recent years, researchers have turned to phage therapy as a promising alternative to combat TB, especially in cases where conventional antibiotics fail. Let\u2019s explore how phages could revolutionize TB treatment. The Problem with Drug-Resistant TB</p> <p>TB is traditionally treated with a combination of antibiotics over several months. However, the rise of multidrug-resistant (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR-TB) strains has created an urgent need for new treatment strategies. MDR-TB does not respond to at least isoniazid and rifampicin, the two most potent first-line TB drugs. XDR-TB, on the other hand, is resistant to an even wider range of antibiotics, making it harder to treat and increasing the chances of treatment failure.</p> <p>The global fight against TB is being hampered by these drug-resistant strains, and the development of new antibiotics is lagging behind. This is where phage therapy comes in as a potential game-changer. What Are Phages?</p> <p>Phages, short for bacteriophages, are naturally occurring viruses that specifically infect and kill bacteria. Each phage is highly specific to its bacterial host, making it a targeted weapon against bacterial infections. Unlike antibiotics, which can kill beneficial bacteria and contribute to drug resistance, phages only infect and destroy their target bacteria.</p> <p>Phages are also ubiquitous in nature, found in soil, water, and even in our own bodies. This makes them an abundant resource for developing novel therapies. Phage Therapy for TB</p> <p>Phage therapy involves using bacteriophages to specifically target and kill Mycobacterium tuberculosis in patients. The potential of phages to combat TB has garnered increasing attention, especially given their success in treating other bacterial infections like Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Some of the key advantages of phage therapy for TB include:</p> <pre><code>Targeted Action: Phages attack only the bacteria they are designed to infect, leaving human cells and beneficial bacteria unharmed.\nMinimal Resistance: Phage resistance can evolve, but unlike antibiotic resistance, phage resistance can be more easily managed by combining different phages or evolving new ones in the lab.\nBiofilm Penetration: Phages can penetrate bacterial biofilms, protective layers that TB bacteria form in the lungs, which make antibiotic treatment less effective.\n</code></pre> <p>Recent Advances in Phage Research</p> <p>Research into using phages against TB is still in the early stages, but some promising developments are already taking shape. One major breakthrough occurred when researchers successfully treated a case of XDR-TB in a teenager using a phage cocktail after antibiotics had failed. This case demonstrated the potential of phages to save lives where traditional treatments fall short.</p> <p>In addition, scientists have identified several phages that can infect Mycobacterium tuberculosis. These phages are being studied for their effectiveness against different strains of TB, including MDR and XDR forms. As research continues, the potential for creating phage cocktails tailored to individual patients is becoming more of a reality, a personalized approach that could greatly improve treatment outcomes. Challenges to Phage Therapy for TB</p> <p>Despite the potential benefits, phage therapy is not without its challenges. Some of the hurdles that need to be overcome before phage therapy can be widely adopted include:</p> <pre><code>Regulatory Approvals: Phage therapy is still in its infancy, and much work needs to be done to standardize treatments and gain regulatory approvals.\nPhage Delivery: Phages need to be delivered effectively to the site of infection, which can be difficult with TB since the bacteria hide inside human cells. Innovative delivery mechanisms, such as inhaled phage treatments, are being explored.\nImmune Response: Phages are foreign entities, and the human immune system may recognize and neutralize them before they can work against the bacteria. Understanding how to mitigate this response is critical for the success of phage therapy.\n</code></pre> <p>The Future of TB Treatment</p> <p>As the world battles drug-resistant TB, phage therapy holds the promise of a new, more effective treatment approach. While there are still obstacles to overcome, the early successes in research and case studies offer hope that phages could one day become a crucial tool in the fight against TB.</p> <p>With continued advancements in biotechnology and a growing understanding of phage biology, the possibility of personalized phage treatments for TB is no longer a distant dream. The future of infectious disease treatment may very well lie in these microscopic viruses, offering a solution to one of humanity's oldest and deadliest foes.</p> <p>By exploring the untapped potential of bacteriophages in TB treatment, we may be on the verge of discovering a powerful new weapon in our fight against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

My final project focused on leveraging 16S rRNA sequencing to uncover microbial diversity, taxonomic composition, and potential functional roles within various biological samples. Project Overview</p> <p>The primary goal of this project was to develop and optimize a workflow for 16S rRNA gene sequencing, targeting the hypervariable regions (V3-V4) to achieve a high-resolution profile of bacterial communities. The project utilized next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies to generate large datasets, which were subsequently analyzed to classify microorganisms present in complex samples. Key Objectives:</p> <pre><code>Amplification of 16S rRNA hypervariable regions\nLibrary preparation and sequencing on an Illumina platform\nTaxonomic classification using established bioinformatics pipelines\nComparison of microbial diversity across different sample types\n</code></pre> <p>Methodology 1. Sample Preparation and DNA Extraction</p> <p>The project began with the isolation of total genomic DNA from various sample types, including human gut microbiome and environmental samples. High-quality DNA was extracted using commercial kits, ensuring sufficient yield and purity for downstream processes. 2. PCR Amplification of 16S rRNA Gene</p> <p>The 16S rRNA gene's hypervariable regions, specifically V3-V4, were amplified using universal primers that are highly conserved across bacterial species. This PCR step was critical in generating a library of 16S amplicons for sequencing. 3. Illumina Sequencing</p> <p>After amplification, the library was prepared for sequencing on an Illumina platform. The use of paired-end sequencing allowed for greater coverage of the 16S rRNA gene, enhancing taxonomic resolution and providing more accurate community profiling. 4. Bioinformatics Pipeline</p> <p>Following sequencing, the raw reads were processed using the following bioinformatics tools:</p> <pre><code>DADA2: This pipeline was employed for quality control, filtering, and dereplication of raw sequencing data, resulting in amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) rather than traditional operational taxonomic units (OTUs). DADA2 also corrected sequencing errors, leading to more accurate identification of species.\nQIIME2: This open-source platform was used to perform taxonomic classification based on reference databases like SILVA and Greengenes. QIIME2 also enabled downstream diversity analyses, including alpha and beta diversity metrics.\nPhyloseq: For data visualization, Phyloseq was used in R to generate plots of microbial composition and diversity, providing insights into the microbial ecosystems present in the samples.\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>Taxonomic Classification</li> </ol> <p>The processed sequences were classified into taxonomic groups using reference databases. This step allowed for the identification of bacteria at the genus and species levels, providing a comprehensive overview of the microbial community structure. 6. Diversity Analysis</p> <p>Alpha diversity metrics (e.g., Shannon and Simpson indices) were calculated to assess the richness and evenness of bacterial species within each sample. Beta diversity analysis was performed to compare microbial compositions between different samples, using techniques such as principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and hierarchical clustering. Key Findings</p> <pre><code>High Microbial Diversity: The human gut microbiome samples revealed a rich diversity of bacterial taxa, with a dominance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, consistent with previous studies. Environmental samples, on the other hand, exhibited greater variability, highlighting the influence of environmental factors on microbial composition.\n\nTaxonomic Resolution: The use of ASVs instead of OTUs provided higher taxonomic resolution, enabling more accurate identification of species. This approach also minimized the inflation of microbial diversity due to sequencing errors.\n\nData-Driven Insights: The comparative analysis between human and environmental samples offered valuable insights into how microbial communities adapt and thrive in different conditions, suggesting potential applications in health, agriculture, and environmental monitoring.\n</code></pre> <p>Future Work and Applications</p> <p>Building on this project, the workflow can be expanded to explore:</p> <pre><code>Metagenomic sequencing: For deeper functional analysis of the microbiome, integrating metagenomics would allow the identification of genes involved in critical metabolic pathways.\nLongitudinal studies: Tracking microbial shifts over time, particularly in response to external factors such as diet, medication, or environmental changes.\nClinical diagnostics: Applying 16S rRNA genotyping for rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria, with potential use in diagnosing infections or understanding the role of the microbiome in chronic diseases.\n</code></pre> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>This project underscored the power of 16S rRNA genotyping in elucidating microbial communities across diverse environments. By employing state-of-the-art bioinformatics tools like DADA2 and QIIME2, the analysis produced high-resolution microbial profiles, enhancing our understanding of microbial ecosystems. This project lays the foundation for future studies and practical applications in microbiome research, offering insights that could impact both human health and environmental science.</p>"},{"location":"projects/microarray/","title":"Microarray Data Processing","text":"<p>This project focuses on processing microarray <code>.CEL</code> files to extract meaningful biological insights.
