# Welcome

I’m **Glory** – a passionate MLS with a focus on **Bioinformatics** and **Molecular Pathology**. My career revolves around analyzing complex datasets, especially in the context of pharmacogenomics and molecular biology. Through this platform, I aim to share my journey, projects, and insights in these dynamic fields.



## My Areas of Expertise

- **Microarray Technology**: Analyzing .CEL files to extract meaningful gene expression patterns.
- **Pharmacogenomics**: Exploring the potential of genetic information to optimize drug treatments.
- **RNA-seq Analysis**: Building automated pipelines for RNA-seq data using Python and Nextflow.
- **Bioinformatics Tools**: Nextflow, Python, Docker, AWS, Linux etc... 

## Current Projects

### 1. [Pharmacogenomics Data Analysis](docs/projects/pharmacogenomics.md)
I’m currently working on processing microarray data to analyze genetic markers in pharmacogenomics. This project aims to help clinicians make informed decisions about personalized medicine based on patient-specific genetic data.

### 2. RNA-Seq Pipeline Development
As part of CPGR’s multi-OMICs approach, I’m developing an RNA-seq pipeline using **Nextflow** and bioinformatics tools like **STAR** and **DESeq2**. The pipeline automates transcriptomics data processing from raw sequences to meaningful biological insights.

### 3. Next-gen Pharmacogenomics for Diabetic Patients
I’m laying the groundwork for a **Pharmacogenomics** platform, starting with **microarray data**. To enable more personalized treatment and nutritional recommendations for diabetics & pre-diabetics.

## Blog

I frequently write about bioinformatics trends, data science, and my personal experiences in molecular biology. Some of the topics I plan to cover include:

- **The Role of Bioinformatics in Precision Medicine**
- **Nextflow: A Game-Changer for Bioinformatics Pipelines**
- **Molecular Pathology Meets Data Science: New Frontiers**
