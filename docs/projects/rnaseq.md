RNA-seq Analysis Pipeline

RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a powerful technique for analyzing the transcriptome, enabling insights into gene expression, splicing variants, and transcript isoforms. As part of my ongoing work in bioinformatics, I have designed and integrated a robust RNA-seq analysis pipeline using Nextflow, leveraging its ability to orchestrate complex workflows and scale across different compute environments.
Objectives

The goal of this pipeline is to provide a comprehensive and automated approach to processing RNA-seq data, from raw sequencing reads to differential expression analysis. The pipeline is designed to be flexible, scalable, and reproducible, addressing the following key tasks:

    Quality control of RNA-seq reads
    Read alignment to reference genomes
    Quantification of gene expression
    Differential expression analysis
    Visualization and reporting of results

Tools and Technologies
1. Nextflow

Nextflow is at the core of this pipeline, allowing for seamless parallel execution of tasks across different computational environments. By incorporating Nextflow, the pipeline is modular and easy to maintain, allowing for the inclusion of new tools or methods as needed. It also ensures reproducibility by providing an auditable trail of each step performed during analysis.

2. FastQC

FastQC is used to assess the quality of raw RNA-seq reads before further processing. This step ensures that the reads meet quality thresholds before alignment, identifying potential issues such as adapter contamination, poor quality scores, or overrepresented sequences.

3. Trim Galore!

Trim Galore! is employed for adapter trimming and removal of low-quality bases. This ensures that only high-quality, relevant data is passed to the alignment step, improving downstream analyses.

4. STAR

For read alignment, STAR is utilized due to its speed and accuracy, particularly in handling splice junctions, which are crucial for RNA-seq data. STAR maps the reads to a reference genome and outputs sorted BAM files, which are essential for accurate quantification.

5. featureCounts

Once the reads are aligned, featureCounts is used to quantify gene expression levels. This tool provides counts of reads mapped to each gene, which are subsequently used for differential expression analysis.

6. DESeq2

For differential expression analysis, DESeq2 is employed. It compares expression levels between different sample conditions, identifying genes that are significantly up- or down-regulated. DESeq2 is particularly useful in its ability to handle complex experimental designs and account for biological variability.

7. MultiQC

To ensure comprehensive reporting, MultiQC compiles reports from various stages of the pipeline, such as FastQC, STAR, and DESeq2, into a single summary document. This makes it easy to assess the overall quality and performance of the entire pipeline.
Workflow Overview

The pipeline is structured as follows:

    Raw Data Quality Control: FastQC is run on the raw reads to identify any issues that need addressing.
    Trimming: Trim Galore! is used to remove adapter sequences and low-quality bases from the reads.
    Alignment: STAR aligns the trimmed reads to the reference genome, generating BAM files.
    Gene Quantification: featureCounts calculates the number of reads mapped to each gene.
    Differential Expression: DESeq2 is applied to determine differentially expressed genes between experimental conditions.
    Reporting: MultiQC aggregates the reports from the entire process and generates an HTML summary.

Future Improvements

I plan to extend this pipeline by incorporating additional functionalities such as alternative splicing analysis and pathway enrichment. These enhancements will provide deeper insights into the biological significance of the results. I am also exploring the integration of cloud-based computational resources using AWS HPC, further improving scalability and accessibility.
Conclusion

This RNA-seq analysis pipeline serves as a foundation for my work in bioinformatics. By utilizing tools like Nextflow, I ensure that the workflow is reproducible, scalable, and efficient. As I continue to refine this pipeline, I look forward to applying it to real-world datasets, such as those generated at the Centre for Proteomics and Genomics Research (CPGR), where I can contribute meaningful insights to ongoing research.
