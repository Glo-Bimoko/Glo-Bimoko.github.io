# üß† Lessons from My First Research Project  
## What a clinical honors project taught me about real-world diagnostics

Before I started working with high-throughput genomics data and building workflows with tools like Nextflow and Python, I took my first steps into the world of molecular diagnostics through my honors project.

The study focused on the use of **16S rRNA genotyping** as a diagnostic tool for **infective endocarditis (IE)** and **blood culture-negative IE (BCNIE)**. A challenging condition to diagnose in clinical settings, especially in regions like South Africa where access to advanced diagnostics can vary.

Using a Sanger-based approach with universal bacterial primers, I compared molecular results to traditional culture outcomes from cardiac tissue and blood samples. It wasn‚Äôt glamorous bioinformatics ‚Äî no pipelines, no metagenomics, just real-world clinical data and a lot of Excel cleaning. But it taught me:

### Key Takeaways

- **Diagnostics isn‚Äôt always about shiny tech**: Even a low-throughput assay like 16S rRNA sequencing can offer diagnostic value, especially for culture-negative infections.
- **Molecular results need clinical context**: False positives, contaminants, or ambiguous taxonomy (e.g., *Streptococcus* vs. *Staphylococcus*) taught me that lab results mean little without patient history.
- **Sensitivity ‚â† specificity**: I learned to balance the excitement of detecting ‚Äúsomething‚Äù with the caution needed in interpreting what that something really is.
- **Limitations can spark innovation**: The experience made me think critically about how NGS and better bioinformatics tools (like RIPSeq or metagenomics) could improve what we were trying to do.

### How It Shaped Me

This project grounded me in **molecular microbiology**, and helped me appreciate both the **promise and pitfalls of sequencing in diagnostics**. It gave me empathy for the challenges clinical labs face, and made me want to build better, more scalable bioinformatics tools. A mission I continue today through my work with microarray analysis and digital health solutions.
