# Next-gen pharmacogenomics

Throughout my life, several of my close family and friends have been plagued with conditions such as diabetes and cancer. Some have even been taken from me due to these conditions. These experiences have deeply influenced my path, instilling in me a sense of responsibility to use my skills and make a difference. 

During my honors studies in medical laboratory science, I gained a transformative perspective—one that allowed me to see things those close to me could not, such as the unseen world of microbes and phages. It felt like a superpower that came with a weighty responsibility. As the saying goes, "with great power comes great responsibility." I knew that if I let this knowledge remain idle, I would never forgive myself for not using it to help the people I care about.

This personal drive now fuels my work in developing a next-generation pharmacogenomics platform. By leveraging microarray data to analyze genetic markers, I aim to advance personalized medicine and provide clinicians with actionable insights based on patient-specific genetic information.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on analyzing microarray data to identify genetic markers associated with drug response and disease risk. By understanding the genetic basis of individual variations in drug metabolism and efficacy, the platform seeks to enable more precise and effective treatment strategies. My work involves processing and interpreting complex datasets, including .CEL files, to extract meaningful insights that can inform clinical decision-making.

## Target Applications

### Personalized Oncology Treatments
One of the key goals is to support personalized treatment plans for oncology patients. By identifying genetic markers that predict response to specific cancer therapies, the platform can guide clinicians in selecting the most effective treatments, reducing trial-and-error approaches, and minimizing adverse effects.

### Nutritional Recommendations for Diabetics
The platform also aims to provide personalized nutritional advice for diabetic and pre-diabetic patients. By integrating genetic information with dietary data, it seeks to optimize nutritional interventions that support blood sugar control and overall metabolic health. This aligns closely with my mission to improve health outcomes for individuals with chronic conditions, including my loved ones.

## Vision and Impact
Through this work, I aim to bridge the gap between genomics and clinical practice, empowering healthcare providers with data-driven tools for precision medicine. Starting with diabetes management and oncology, I envision extending the platform to other areas of healthcare, creating a comprehensive solution for next-generation pharmacogenomics. Ultimately, the goal is to enhance therapeutic outcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and improve quality of life for patients worldwide. This project is not just about advancing science; for me, it is deeply personal—a way to honor those I’ve lost and to protect those I hold dear.
