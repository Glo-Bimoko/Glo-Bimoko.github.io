# Welcome

Hi, I’m **Glory Bimoko** – a passionate Microarray Technician with a focus on **Bioinformatics**, **Molecular Pathology**, and **Data Science**. My career revolves around analyzing complex datasets, especially in the context of pharmacogenomics and molecular biology. Through this platform, I aim to share my journey, projects, and insights in these dynamic fields.

## About Me

With a strong foundation in medical laboratory science, I specialize in **molecular pathology** and **bioinformatics**. My current role at the **Centre for Proteomics and Genomics Research (CPGR)** allows me to work at the cutting edge of OMICS technologies, with a particular focus on **microarray analysis** and **multi-OMICS data integration**. I’m also pursuing a master’s degree in **Data Science and Bioinformatics** at the University of Cape Town, furthering my knowledge in computational biology and data analytics.

## My Areas of Expertise

- **Microarray Technology**: Analyzing .CEL files to extract meaningful gene expression patterns.
- **Pharmacogenomics**: Exploring the potential of genetic information to optimize drug treatments.
- **RNA-seq Analysis**: Building automated pipelines for RNA-seq data using Python and Nextflow.
- **Bioinformatics Tools**: Proficient in tools like R, Python, and Linux for data manipulation and analysis.

## Current Projects

### 1. Pharmacogenomics Data Analysis
I’m currently working on processing microarray data to analyze genetic markers in pharmacogenomics. This project aims to help clinicians make informed decisions about personalized medicine based on patient-specific genetic data.

### 2. RNA-Seq Pipeline Development
As part of CPGR’s multi-OMICs approach, I’m developing an RNA-seq pipeline using **Nextflow** and bioinformatics tools like **STAR** and **DESeq2**. The pipeline automates transcriptomics data processing from raw sequences to meaningful biological insights.

### 3. Digital Twin Project for Diabetic Patients
I’m laying the groundwork for a **digital twin** platform, starting with **microarray data** from **Thermo Fisher Scientific PMDA** tests. The goal is to model digital twins for patients, especially those with diabetes, enabling more personalized treatment and nutritional recommendations.

## Blog

I frequently write about bioinformatics trends, data science, and my personal experiences in molecular biology. Some of the topics I plan to cover include:

- **The Role of Bioinformatics in Precision Medicine**
- **Nextflow: A Game-Changer for Bioinformatics Pipelines**
- **Molecular Pathology Meets Data Science: New Frontiers**
